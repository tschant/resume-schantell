## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Why?

I was bored and wanted non-traditional webpage to play with. I love unix and spend majority of my time in the terminal. 

This is a passion project for me, and a resume webpage seemed like the best fit as I will always be able to update it, will show my coding expertise, and growth.
